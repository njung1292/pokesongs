pokesongs
=========

This webapp allows users to search for a video game and listen to a continuous playlist of music from that game.

The app pulls games and songs from http://brawlcustommusic.com, a website that allows users to listen to a preview of each song featured in a particular game. Although the site is a great resource, it can be tiresome for the user to click on each individual link when all she really wants is to listen to one Pokemon Ruby song after another while procrastinating on homework. (Heck this whole hack was one big procrastinatory diversion...)

This app employs the following:
* Node.js
* Socket.io
* Twitter Typeahead
* ZeroClipboard
* node-yql

~~Try it out at http://pokesongs.herokuapp.com.~~ It appears http://brawlcustommusic.com is down, so you will not be able to get past the adorable kitty page. (^._.^)ï¾‰
